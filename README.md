# geminabox-railway

Template for using Geminabox on Railway (one-click deployment!)

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/RorgjU?referralCode=SrqHJ0&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

## Configuring

You can set the `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD` to whatever you want, unless you want your instance to be public.
I recommend using `${{secret(N_DIGITS)}}` for the password.
